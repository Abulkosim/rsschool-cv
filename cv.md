Summary
-------

I'm currently studying at INHA University in Tashkent, and I've been studying Computer Science for more than two years. I'm an autodidact and a very fast learner. If I come across something really difficult while I'm learning, I don't think of it as a problem, because with a bit of hard work, I'm sure, I can easily pick it up. The main reason why I've always been passionate about programming is that it helps us solve different kinds of problems. This motivates me to do what I'm doing. And although I'm not very experienced, I believe that I can greatly contribute to your company in the future.
